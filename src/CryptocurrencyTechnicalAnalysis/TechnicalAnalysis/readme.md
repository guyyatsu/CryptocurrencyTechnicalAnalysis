### Simple Moving Averages
A moving average is the mean of a certain number of periods conducted over a series; it's used to determine
if the trend on a graph is moving upwards or downwards, based on the direction it is currently moving.  The
main draw to it being it's ability to "_remember_" larger periods of time so as to provide a moderately **unresponsive**
demeanor when generating `buy` or `sell` signals.

The `SMA` algorithm can be used as the basis for other more complex algorithms based on comparisons between `shorter` and `longer`
window-frames of periods to average together.
